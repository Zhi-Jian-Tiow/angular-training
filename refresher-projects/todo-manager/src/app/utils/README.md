Implement a "truncate" pipe:

- Accepts a string and a max-length parameter.
- If the string exceeds max-length, it should return a truncated version plus an ellipsis.
- Implement this as an Angular Pipe when you build the solution.

Implement a "highlight-on-hover" directive:

- Adds a CSS class or inline style when mouse enters/focuses the host element.
- Removes it on mouse leave/blur.
- Should also respond to keyboard focus for accessibility.
